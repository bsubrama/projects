This is a basic implementation of life: one that illustrates the game itself.

The overall design of this basic edition is as follows:

Arena represented as a 2D vector of vectors of booleans. 
A second vector of vectors is kept.
The changes are applied based upon the state of each cell in the first 2d array
to the second 2d array. 
The second 2D array is copied to the first and simultaneously set to false.
The arena is initialized using random seeding. 
The user can control the size of the arena, and the number of initial cells
alive, and the number of generations to do the simulation. 
Every generation will be written out to a file.
